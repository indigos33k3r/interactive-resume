              </p>
              <p>
                My name is Piotr, and I am a developer with strong focus on front-end, though I'm not limiting myself only
                to this area of expertise.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>So, what is your profession?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy making web applications, hybrid mobile apps and.. games. Last one currently for pure fun.
                No challenge is to great and sky is the limit.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>But what for!?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Why I actually do this? Due to pure love of development. It's basically like Lego bricks -
                enjoyable, challenging, and unquestionably awesome.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>I hate you!</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I encourage you to check out this modest resume of mine, you'll certainly find some nifty stuff about me or
                just have some fun scrolling back and forth.
